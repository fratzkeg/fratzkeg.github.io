        <h2>Garrett Fratzke, 10/16</h2>
        <p>I had some troubles remembering some of the specifics regarding putting images into a file, but other than that, I just had to learn how to use and connect Git to VS Code.</p>
        <p>I learned more about Git and how to use it during this assignment. I mostly used a website called w3schools.com when I had issues with my code. No reason behind it, it was just the first option that came up when searching my problem.</p>

        <h2>Garrett Fratzke, 10/30</h2>

        <p>I learnt more about using CSS and how it can be appliciable to every web application and website made</p>

        <p>I was challenged by my javascript knowledge as it was lacking but with some help using online resources I was able to figure out my issues</p>
        <p>I learnt more about the uses of javascript and how it works to interact with HTML and CSS. It was all very new to me</p>
        <p>I used some online resources such as geeks for geeks as a way to see if I was using functions correctly. </p>

        <h2>Garrett Fratzke, 11/20</h2>
        <p>I had some trouble with the pathing, I was thinking about it in the wrong way. To work through them I went to a classmate to get a second pair of eyes on it and see how to fix it.</p>
        <p>I learnt about how to run a node.js server. I did not know how to do that before. I learned a lot on this project. I knew some of the JS though.</p>
        <p>I used classmates as a sounding board and to get a second pair of eyes on the project.</p>

        <h2>Garrett Fratzke, 12/6</h2>
