        <h1>Blog #1</h1>
        <h2>Garrett Fratzke, 10/16</h2>
        <p>I had some troubles remembering some of the specifics regarding putting images into a file, but other than that, I just had to learn how to use and connect Git to VS Code.</p>
        <p>I learned more about Git and how to use it during this assignment. I mostly used a website called w3schools.com when I had issues with my code. No reason behind it, it was just the first option that came up when searching my problem.</p>
